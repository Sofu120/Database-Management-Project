# Intranet CRM System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive intranet-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system designed to manage customer data and sales information efficiently. Our objective is to create a user-friendly platform that streamlines the processes of creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) customer and sales records. Additionally, this system is built with robust user authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure data security and integrity.
